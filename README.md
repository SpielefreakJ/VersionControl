# VersionControl
## Control the versions of the servers in your network
A small ViaVersion addon. (As  it only works  with ViaVsersion duh)

Get it on [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/versioncontrol-viaversion-addon.95878/)



I wrote the code in a few hours back at the end of 2021, up until January 9th, 2022. Since then i have not worked on it.

It should work still fine, it won't add new versions to the config file automatically.<br/>
In the config files (and on Spigot) you can read how to add them.


The plugin only interacts with the Viaversion API.<br/>
The plugin has BStats integration.
